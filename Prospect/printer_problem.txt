PRB: COM Objects Fail to Print When Called From ASP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

Active Server Pages
Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
A COM object that sends output to a printer fails when called from Active 
Server Pages (ASP), but functions correctly when called from an interactive 
application. This COM object could be either a commercial product such as a 
Microsoft Office application, or a custom third-party object. A common error 
message is "ClassName error '800a01e2' Printer error."



CAUSE
The standard APIs that most objects use to print depend on registry entries 
located in HKEY_CURRENT_USER. This registry hive is dynamic. Depending on 
which user context the process is running under, different information will 
be loaded into this hive. ASP pages run under IIS, which is running as the 
SYSTEM account. When you create an instance of a COM object in your ASP 
code, by default, it will also run as the SYSTEM account. By default, the 
SYSTEM account does not have any printers set up in the registry.



RESOLUTION
You can set up printers for the SYSTEM account to resolve this problem. To 
set up printers for the SYSTEM account, perform the following:

This method requires you to modify the registry using the Registry Editor.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide 
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows to correct them. 
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of 
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.


Ensure that the user you are currently logged into on the server has the 
desired printers installed.


Launch the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).


Select the following key:



      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
         \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Devices

>From the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.


In the File Name text box, type c:\Devices.reg.


Select the following key:



      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
         \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\PrinterPorts

>From the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.


In the File Name text box, type c:\PrinterPorts.reg.


Select the following key:



      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
         \Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows

>From the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.


In the File Name text box, type c:\Windows.reg.


>From the Start button, select Run. Open Devices.reg in Notepad by typing 
Notepad Devices.reg in Run dialog box.


Replace the text HKEY_CURRENT_USER with HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT


Save the file. Then import it into the registry by double-clicking the file 
in Windows Explorer.


Repeat steps 13 through 15 for PrinterPorts.reg and Windows.reg.
