You can use javascript to do it -- use an onload function:

<script language=javascript>
  function printRedirect(){
    window.print();
    setTimeout('location="prevPage.asp"',5000);
  }
</script>

<body onLoad="printRedirect();">

So that the page will spool to the printer, and then redirect itself after five seconds. 
 Only drawback is that they will get the confirmation print dialog box --
 but there isn't any way around that -- there isn't a way to get a webpage to spit off on the printer without any user intervention at all...   they either have to push the button themselves, or they have to ok your .print() action.
